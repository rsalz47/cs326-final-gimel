```

##### > Other persistent storage in use
> project\_dir/simple\_test.c & project\_dir/simple\_test.s
```
Source files used to populate our source-code and assembly views 
on the site
```

> project\_dir/simple\_test
```
Compiled binary of the simple_test.c file. This executable is used to generate cfg.json 
and for the fuzzer to execute so that it can dynamically generate data.
It is compiled for the RISCV architecture to be compatible with the fuzzer in use.
```

> project\_dir/cfg.json & decompiler\_script.py
```
cfg.json is a control-flow graph that was generate using decompiler_script.py and 
the api of a decompiler. The format of it is described below.
{
    "function_name": {
        "control-flow blocks": [
            {
                "memory-address of this block": <addr>,
                "instructions in this block": [
                    "<instr_1>",
                    "<instr_2>".
                ]
            },
        "edges mapping blocks to each other" [
            [
                block_id_0
                block_id_1
            ],
        ]
    },
}
```

> sfuzz & run\_fuzzer.sh
```
sfuzz is the fuzzer used to generate the data for our application to visualize.
The code for it can be found here: https://github.com/seal9055/sfuzz/tree/gimel

run_fuzzer is a runner script that runs it with properly setup arguments
```

#### 3. Deployment
Our website is currently deployed at https://boiling-forest-11261.herokuapp.com/

Automatic deployment is enabled on `main` branch.

#### Work Breakdown
We did almost all of the work on this project together in one room, so we all spent approximately
the same amount of time on this project. We were able to split the project up fairly well during
this time with everyone working on different APIs.
