####Fizzy: A Fuzzing Visualizing Tool
This project is a tool for data visualization. The application is targeted at small groups of power-users (such as vulnerability researchers) that are interested in a shared data visualization instance. This application is meant to be ran as a private instance being hosted locally by the respective teams.

The application enables multiple users to review and annotate the displayed data. Users will be provided with multiple formats of data visualization to best suit their needs.

It is mainly intended to be used with program analysis tooling such as fuzzers/tracers that emit a lot of structured data that would benefit from human readable visualization, and our given layouts are configured with that in mind.

This tool is innovative because such specialized data visualization tools are rare and aren't commonly used for the most part.
